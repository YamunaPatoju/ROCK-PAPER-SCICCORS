How the Game Works:
1.Player Input: Both players are prompted to enter their choice: rock, paper, or scissor.
2.Validation: The game checks if both inputs are valid choices.
3.Decision Logic:
-If one player's choice beats the other, the game announces the winner based on the rules.
-If both players choose the same option, the game declares a draw.
4.Result Display: The outcome is printed with an explanation of why a player won or if it's a draw.

FEATURES:
-Two-player mode
-Clear winner announcement
-Input validation for correct choices (rock/paper/scissor)
